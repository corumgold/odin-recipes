# odin-recipes
The Odin Project recipes exercise

I had a good time getting refreshed on HTML! It felt a bit repetitive having to do multiple recipe pages, but I understand why - we need to practice the skills! I very much like how Odin is set up beacause there is much less hand holding and "watch-and-do" style learning - you have to figure it out for yourself! 

Things are very easy right now, and skills are coming back to me, but I know that will all change here soon!...
