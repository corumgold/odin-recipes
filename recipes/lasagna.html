    <p>This is a simpler take on the lasagna my mom used to make when I was growing up. This lasagna is delicious and
        super easy to whip up with just a few ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Lb Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 Diced Onion</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>1 28 Oz Can Crushed Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>1 15 Oz Package Whole Milk Ricotta</li>
        <li>3 1/2 Cups Shredded Mozarella</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Parmesan</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Chopped Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until beef has
            browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to
            taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the
            ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles,
            tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until top is
            browned in spots.</li>
        <li>Let cool 15 minutes. Serve, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
