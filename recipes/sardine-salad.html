    <h1>Sardine Salad</h1>
    <p>This is a different spin on a popular tuna salad recipe; however this recipe uses a much healthier fish -
        sardines! This recipe will certainly have a stronger fish flavor than your typical tuna salad, however it is
        quite delicious especially on your favorite toasted bread!</p>
